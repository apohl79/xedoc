//! Pipe-table holdback scanner for source-backed agent streams.
//!
//! Agent streams with markdown tables keep the active table as mutable tail so
//! adding a row can reflow earlier table rows instead of committing a stale
//! render to scrollback.
//!
//! The scanner is intentionally conservative: it only looks for enough
//! structure to decide where the mutable tail should start. It does not try to
//! validate an entire table or predict final layout. Rendering remains the job
//! of the markdown renderer.
